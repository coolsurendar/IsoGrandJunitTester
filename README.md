# IsoGrandJunitTester

The project helps to test code challenges available in websistes like IsoGrand
While working on code challenges, I had to find a easy way to test the new code challenges and hence wrote few junit tests that help me with this.
The website gives the input and output txt files. The Junit test here simply reads and sends as an input to the program. 

To make use of this, 
1. You can download the input and expected output files from the code challenge and paste them into test/resources directory. 
2. Adapt the IsoContextTest.java to the number of input/output files
3. Code the challenge in IsoContest.java file

Now as you code, you can easily test them using Junit
